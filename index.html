    <h1>My name is Martin Ng</h1>

<p>I am a student who is trying to get a head in life. Growing up I learn a lot in school, but I have a problem making friends and would spend sometime alone. But I do have some friends and I hang out with them from time to time.   
<br>I've always struggle to learn all I can in each school I have been. The problem is I sometimes get easily distracted and I would not pay attention to my work. And sometimes I'm a little lazy and would turn in my work a little late. Thankfully, it sometimes doesn't affect my grade. 
<br>When it comes to studying, I sometimes have a hard time trying to understand what I read and would sometimes struggle when it comes to pop quizzes as I am very confused. And when it comes to exams, there are times when I pass and sometimes fail.
<br> But no matter how hard some of the work maybe, I will always try again and do my best. When I'm not busy doing work, I like to be on the internet and play video games in my spare time. And I also like to watch movies at home and in Century Theatres in the Tanforan Mall.
<br> I also like to eat fruits and vegetables. I also like to eat candy and potato chips, but I like beef jerky most of all. Sometimes I eat too much, but I always know when to stop. Sooner or later, I will have to lose some weight and live my life to the fullest.
