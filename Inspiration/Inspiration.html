    <h1>My name is Martin Ng and my major is Visual Communications</h1>

    <h2>These are the video game companies and music artist that inspires me:</h2>
    

    <a href= "https://sonyinteractive.com/en/"><h3><en>Sony Interactive Entertainment</en></h3></a>

    <img src="img/910sCuej5IL._SL1500_.jpg" alt="The video game Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves which was developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment in 2005.">
    <h4>The games that Sony Interactive Entertainment had made all kinds of games that I played on my Playstation systems such as <en>Jak and Daxter</en>, <en>Sly Cooper</en>, and <en>Ratchet & Clank</en>.
        <br>The gameplay that the company designed for each of those games is what inspired me to write good stories on fanfiction websites.</h4>

    <a href="https://insomniac.games/"><h3>Insomniac Games</h3></a>

    <img src="img/81d6JU6g1pL._SL1500_.jpg" alt="The Marvel's Spider-Man video game cover for Playstaion 4, developed by Insomniac Games in 2018.">
<h4>Insomniac Games have made some good games such as the Marvel's Spider-Man franchise and the new Ratchet & Clank game. I like the artwork that the artists made for the Spider-Man games.
    <br> I also like graphic and art design on all of the Spider-Man games and other games developed by this company and wonder if I can make good art like the artists that work for Insomniac Games. </h4>

<h4>I admire the songs that Keke Palmer had sung in her albums over the years. The songs that I listened to were both inspirational and unique. 
    <br>Each of her songs are both expressive and has a clear message to everyone that listens to them. I guess that some of Keke's music has a lot of meaning in them as well.</h4>
